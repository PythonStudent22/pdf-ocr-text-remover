# pdf-ocr-text-remover
A Python script using PyMuPDF (fitz) that removes OCR scans from PDF files. It processes the PDF to eliminate recognized text from OCR processing, especially useful for scanned paper documents. Note: Any computer-generated text in the PDF will also be removed, so it's ideal for scanned paper pages.
